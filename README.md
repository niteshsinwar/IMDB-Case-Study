# EDA IMDb Movie Assessment
This repository contains the code and analysis for the EDA IMDb movie assessment project. The goal of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset of IMDb movies to gain insights into the relationships between movie characteristics and their ratings.

## Project Overview
The project was conducted in the following stages:

- Data collection and cleaning: The raw data was obtained from the IMDb website and cleaned to remove any missing or inconsistent values.

- Data exploration: Exploratory data analysis techniques were used to identify patterns and relationships in the data, including visualizations, statistical tests, and clustering analysis.

- Insight generation: Insights were generated based on the analysis of the data, including identifying which movie characteristics are most strongly correlated with high ratings, and identifying trends in movie popularity over time.

- Report creation: A final report was created summarizing the findings of the analysis, including visualizations and statistical summaries.


## Results
- The analysis revealed several interesting insights, including:

- The top-rated movies tend to be those with a higher number of votes, indicating that popular movies are more likely to be highly rated.

- There is a strong positive correlation between the duration of a movie and its rating, indicating that longer movies tend to be better received.

- Movies in the Drama, Comedy, and Action genres tend to have higher ratings than other genres.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the value of exploratory data analysis in gaining insights into complex datasets. By using a combination of visualizations, statistical tests, and clustering analysis, we were able to identify patterns and relationships in the IMDb movie data that would have been difficult to identify using intuition alone.
